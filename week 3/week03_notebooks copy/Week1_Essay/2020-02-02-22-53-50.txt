<p>As per the article, the evolution of data science over the past years involves the work of several mathematicians, scientists, and international organizations. Their contributions are not directly related to data science but they have defined the vital building blocks of data science. Initially,<em> </em>John W Tukey brought the idea of a relationship between statistics and analysis. Peter Naur published the ‘Concise Survey of Computer Methods’ which is a collection of modern data processing methods. He used the term ‘Data Science’ several times and later defined the same. The first Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD) Workshop was organized. Business Week published a cover story on Database Marketing which is considered as the first concept of data analysis towards commercial gain. This cover story gives a hint of how we should reuse our data. The International Federation of Classification Societies for the first time included the term Data Science in the conference title. Professor Jeff Wu put forward a proposal to rename statistics as data science and similarly statisticians as data scientists. Few more proposals flew in stating the need for new tools to manage the huge amount of information and involvement of faculty members in the data science department. With the release of all these journals and social networking sites, the use of data has started impacting society. The competition has changed and the need, as well as awareness of the field, has increased. Data science developed rapidly worldwide in the last decade and has become the most important part of all aspects.</p>
