The story of data scientist began with the coupling of statistics and computer science. The article mentions about how the term data science came to be used over the years and explain the emergence of enormous data in recent years.  “Companies are collecting mountains of information about you, crunching it to predict how likely you are to buy a product, and using that knowledge to craft a marketing message precisely calibrated to get you.”  Conventional statistical methods work well with small data, however, today’s data are millions of rows and scores of columns. These vast amount of data has to be dealt with new technology and newer methods. It demands people who could use both data and science to create something new.  It requires people who are multi-disciplinary. People who are able to combine the skills of software programmer, statistician and storytelling. Data scientists—people who can do it all— emerge from the rest of the pack because of their diverse skillsets.
