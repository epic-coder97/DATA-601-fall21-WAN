<p>“A Very Short History of Data Science”, written by Gil Press and published in Forbes Magazine in 2013, establishes a timeline tracing the origins of the data science field and how it rose to prominence. Press begins the timeline in 1962, citing &quot;The Future of Data Analysis&quot; by mathematician John W. Tukey, in which Tukey comments on the emerging importance of data analysis to the field of statistics. From this prescient prediction, Press' timeline cites instances between 1970 and 1995 of academics defining the term &quot;data science&quot; in journals and the foundation of multiple academic data science organizations. During the 1990s and early 2000s, Press' timeline shows an increase in articles by academics and professionals attempting to settle on definitions for terms, including &quot;data science&quot; and &quot;data mining&quot;. In the 2000s, the trend of the articles suggests that the field of data science distinguished itself from mathematics and statistics by focusing on analyzing data and applying the results of that analysis rather than modeling how the data were created in the first place. The final articles Press lists, ranging from 2005-2012, profile &quot;data scientist&quot; as an emerging job category and include interviews with high-level professionals about desirable skills in data scientists. Overall, Press' article shows that the field of data science emerged as a subfield of academic statistics until industries, beginning with marketing, began to experiment with utilizing data to gain an edge over competitors. Combined with the emergence of the internet and personal computers in the 90s, data science shifted from being an academic subfield to its own field of study and industry.</p>
