<p><em> “A Very Short History of Data Science”</em>, by Gil Press, effectively explores the origins and evolution of the field of data analysis, as well as that of the data scientist. Gil embarks on his chronological journey in 1962, where statisticians and research scientists alike grapple with the idea of applying traditional methods to structured data sets, and the thought that, perhaps the data itself should be allowed to lead the discussion, to generate the questions rather than just validating answers. As Gil’s timeline progresses and technology evolves, the incorporation of computer science into the mix, along-side the mass collection of data, begin to give rise to a hybrid career path. This new archetype incorporates computer scientist, statistician, SME, and story teller into someone who can “convert data into information and knowledge.” The idea of “data science” is born. In the hands of the data scientist traditional statistical methods evolve into complex and scalable algorithms, capable of gleaning meaningful insight from masses of data, visualizing it, and converting it into action. The data scientist becomes an invaluable jack of all trades, with involvement beginning at data collection and ending with executing decisions based on their analysis. Academic institutions and corporations see the value and begin to invest in the field accordingly.  The article states, as its timeline reaches the present, “There is no widely accepted boundary for what's inside and outside of data science's scope.” The field will continue to grow, to incorporate new technologies and evolve antiquated ideas on solving the problems of today and tomorrow; data scientists themselves now control the content and boundaries of their industry.</p>
