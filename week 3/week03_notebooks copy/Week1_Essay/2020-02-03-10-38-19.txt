Carver have stated that statistics as Data Science in the year 1997. A computer scientist William S. Cleveland provided an action plan to strengthen the technical area among statistics with programmers. One of the data science journals described about data systems in 2002. Another journal in 2003 gives an idea on data workers platform. A predictive modelling idea was given by Thomas in the year 2005 in “Long Lived Digital Data”. In order to improve the way of understanding in data science a “Venn diagram” was introduced by Dern cornway in 2010 for better data modelling.</p>
