<p>This article explains the history, evolution, use, and efforts to define the term Data science throughout the years from 1962 to 2012. It mentions the evolution of mathematical statistics to data analysis which takes characteristics of science rather than maths. The definition of Data Science came out as: “The science of dealing with data, once they have been established, while the relation of the data to what they represent is delegated to other fields and sciences”. The mission of converting data into information and knowledge was started. In 1994, companies started collecting huge amounts of data of people and processed it to draw some conclusions and accordingly they started planning their marketing strategies. Different names were given to the findings of useful patterns in data. Different data models and diverse tools were introduced to reach conclusions from data. Journal of Data Science was launched which provided a platform for all data workers to present their views &amp; exchange ideas. The Research Centre for Dataology and Data Science was established in China. In 2009, it was stated that the ability to take data, understand it, process it, extract value from it, visualize it, communicate it, that is going to be the most important skill in the next decades. In 2010, a new type of specialist has arisen, the data scientist, who can tackle all aspects of the problem, from data collection to drawing conclusions. Moreover, Data Science is a complete mixture of machine learning, statistics, mathematics, and domain of data for analysis. Data Scientist fits the best to those who use data and science to build something unique.</p>
