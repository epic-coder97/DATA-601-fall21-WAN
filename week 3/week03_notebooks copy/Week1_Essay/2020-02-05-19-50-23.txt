<p>I have read the first 10 pages of the article &quot;50 years of data science&quot; . In that article the author David Donoho mentioned that initially everyone thought that data science is done by statistics but later everyone got released that data science is vast area and in order to become a data scientist a person must have a vast number of skill set and statistics is just a part of it. Data science is not a new concept but it became popular in the recent years as there is more amount of data being created world wide. The term big data emerged as the data which is being produced in the day to day life had been increasing enormously. Big data cannot differentiate the difference between statisticians and data scientists as statisticians have been analysis the big data sets from long back which have large number of individuals or measurements or both. The skill set for a data science had been evolving continuously but in the past too scientists solved complex problems using more mathematical skills. In the coming era too data science is going to have a greater importance as the data that is being generated in this world is increasing tremendously so the information that can be retrieved from the data can be used in both scientific and commercial purpose</p>
