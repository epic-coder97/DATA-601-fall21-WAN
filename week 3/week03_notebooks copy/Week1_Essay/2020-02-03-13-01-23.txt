<p>The concept of extracting useful information from the given data is not a recent concept(Data Analysis) but recently data analysis is given more emphasis and continuous development is being done in this stream. Initially people thought that there is lot of similarity between a statistician and a data scientist but later realized that data science is an interdisciplinary area and statistics just provides methods to represent data. Statisticians are very helpful in dealing with big data sets, even before introduction of the term big data they have have done scientific research on data sets having large number of individuals or measurements or both. Data scientists need large number of computational resources and they should have a skill set of open source software framework such as hadoop which has the capability of handling multiple concurrent tasks. To grab a job as a data scientist apart from the traditional knowledge in statistics one must have a skill set in both computing and database. As every country in this world is moving towards technology there is more scope of generating huge amounts of data so data analysis will play a major part commercially in the coming decades.</p>
