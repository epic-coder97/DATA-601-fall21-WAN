50 Years of Data Science 
 
Author D. Donoho starts the article by talking about today’s Data Science moment. 
He mentions the "DSI" Data Science Initiative, announced by the University of Michigan as a $100 million initiative. 
The author also talks about the rivalry between Data Science and Statistics. 
Many applied statisticians consider their professional career as a series of exercises in the collection, management, processing, 
analysis, visualization, and interpretation of vast amounts of data. They find the new DSI initiative a little confusing. 
As they have already been doing the above exercise daily for their entire careers.
The author also compared the definitions of Data Scientists and Statistics. According to him, the definition of statistics is confusing since 
it seems to already encompass anything that the definition of data scientist might encompass. The author tells us how Data Science is just statistics 
by giving an example of when physicists do mathematics, they do not call it number science. The same should be true for DS and statistics. 
Later, he talks about the "big data meme" and how it started with Mark Schlissel’s use of the term "big data" in his press release. 
He also talks about the "skills meme." and how Hadoop (a variant of Map/Reduce) is a skill needed to master Big Data.
Regarding the future of data analysis, Donoho cites John Sullivan, who published a paper in 1962 explaining why he thought 
the research scope of statistics needed to be dramatically widened and redirected. John's 1962 list of factors explains 
the role of statistics in the new science of Data Science.
