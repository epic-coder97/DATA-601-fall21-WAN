    "## What is an API?\n",
    "<p>An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a server that you can use to retrieve and send data to using code. APIs are most commonly used to retrieve data, and that will be the focus of this beginner tutorial.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to receive data from an API, we need to make a request. Requests are used all over the web. For instance, when you visited this blog post, your web browser made a request to the Dataquest web server, which responded with the content of this web page. \n",
    "\n",
    "API requests work in exactly the same way â€“ you make a request to an API server for data, and it responds to your request."
